# Callan Feldspar
## Background
Callan had a mostly quiet life in a crossroads town. His parents got behind on debts owed to local mafia (protection for their meager shop) and Callan volunteered to work to pay for what they owe. Ran errands, made friends, learned "second story skills" over time. Developed a fixation on mechanical objects after burglarizing a clock maker's shop and stealing a powerful book called the [[Clockwork Tome]]. Left the underworld and started creating his own tools and toys as a way to go legit after his parents' debts were paid. Due to his urge for knowledge has kept up the habit of heists whenever the desire and opportunity arises. 

Told parents he's travelling to *nearest big city* to peddle some new items but has actually been infiltrating a goblin rabble nearby. Ultimately planning to use them for distraction and meat shields to rob an armoured convoy transporting half a dozen newly minted ioun stones. Will likely meet the party still mostly painted green. 

Callan is vain and egotistical, adores flattery and despises false modesty. Action is what matters, plans never survive anyways so bring what you think might help and dive in. 

A rock gnome mix of Rocket Raccoon and MacGyver. 

Regularly runs [[Scams and Schemes]] to make money and test out new ideas
