Notes and Tactics

1

-   Magical Tinkering
-   Spellcasting

For your starting gear, take two daggers, a light crossbow and 20 bolts, scale mail, theives’ tools, and a dungeoneering pack. The crossbow is useful when enemies are outside of your cantrip range, but you’ll have better results if you sell it and use the gold to but a shield.

At this level your options are really limited. You’ll feel more like a weird wizard than like an actual artificer. Keep your shield out, prepare spells that will keep you alive, and just try to make it to 2nd level. Fire Bolt will deal enough damage to make you useful in combat, and you long list of proficiencies, Tinker, and Magical Tinkering give you plenty of utility options outside of combat. Bring Cure Wounds to help your allies in combat, but try to avoid using it until you absolutely need to do so; you only have two spell slots.

2

-   Infuse Item
-   Infused Items: 2
-   Infusions Known
    -   Enhanced Arcane Focus
    -   Enhanced Defense
    -   Enhanced Weapon
    -   Replicate Magic Item (Bag of Holding)

Level 2 is where the Artificer really starts to feel like they should. You don’t get any more spell slots, but 2 magic items can be a massive improvement to your capabilities.

If you need nothing else, use Enhanced Arcane Focus and Enhanced Defense to boost your spell attacks and your AC. +1 to AC will bring you up to 19 AC, giving you nearly as much AC as a fighter in full plate. If you have allies to defend you, consider sharing Enhanced Defense and/or Enhanced Weapon.

3

-   Artificer Specialist: Alchemist
-   The Right Tool for the Job
-   Tool Proficiency: Any
-   Alchemist Spells
-   Experimental Elixir (1)

Third level brings a lot of good things. You get another 1st-level spell slot just in time to get an expanded spell list, including the absolutely essential Healing Word. You can stop preparing Cure Wounds, and instead rely on Healing Word for emergency healing in combat.

The Alchemist gains proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies, but we got that at first level, so you get to replace it with any other tool proficiency.

The Right Tool for the Job doesn’t change much, but it’s basically a free set of tools.

This level also brings Experimental Elixir. The free elixir won’t reliably be something that you can count on, but you can turn spells itno elixirs to get a bunch of useful buffs.

4

-   Ability Score Improvement (Constitution Intelligence 16 -> 18)

A bunch of extra hit points, and your spell attacks, DC’s, and a bunch of other things improve.
