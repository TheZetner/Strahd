- Hop in [[Ricktavio]]'s cart to be pulled West out of [[Vallaki]] by his horse Chameleon
- Use a little grappling hook stirrup to climb into the wagon
- Happy to be out of Vallaki and dour instead of with a rictus grin
- Needle blights in the woods
- Arrive at the [[Wizard of Wineries |Wizard of Wine Winery]] 
	- Desolate, vines dead, no one in the fields
	- Leave Ricktavio in the cart (locked up) 
	- Approaching house
	- Hear a rustling behind and see dozens and dozens of needle blights moving towards the house and between us and the cart
